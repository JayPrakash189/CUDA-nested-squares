# CUDA Nested Square Pattern Generator

> **Concurrent Programming** 
---

## Problem Statement

Generate a **nested (concentric) square pattern** using CUDA, where each thread computes the coordinates of concentric squares on a large image grid. Compare performance with a sequential CPU implementation.

- **Dataset:** DS11 – Wikipedia Text Corpus (large-scale data, simulated as a 4096×4096 image grid)

---

## Algorithm

Each pixel `(x, y)` is assigned to exactly one CUDA thread.  
The thread computes the **Chebyshev (L∞) distance** from the image centre:

```
d = max( |x - W/2| , |y - H/2| )
```

If `d % GAP == 0`, the pixel lies on a square boundary → **white (255)**  
Otherwise → **black (0)**

This is an **embarrassingly parallel** problem — every thread is fully independent, with O(1) compute per thread.

## Quick Start — Google Colab

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
2. `Runtime` → `Change runtime type` → Select **T4 GPU** → Save
3. Open `src/nested_squares.ipynb` or paste the code below into a single cell

```python
!pip install numba matplotlib Pillow --quiet
!nvidia-smi
```

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Details |
|---|---|
| Parallelism type | Embarrassingly parallel |
| Thread mapping | 1 thread = 1 pixel |
| Distance metric | Chebyshev (L∞): `max(\|Δx\|, \|Δy\|)` |
| Block size | 16 × 16 = 256 threads/block |
| Grid size | 256 × 256 blocks |
| Memory access | Coalesced writes (consecutive x addresses) |
| Timing method | `cudaEvent` (GPU) / `time.perf_counter` (CPU) |

## Speedup Analysis — Amdahl's Law

```
Speedup = 1 / (S + (1 - S) / N)
```

Where `S` = serial fraction, `N` = parallel processors.  
Serial portion in our code (memcpy + host logic) ≈ 1–2%  
→ Theoretical max speedup ≈ **50–100×** ✓
